Implementation of a memory allocator.

Characteristics:
    A doubly-linked list is used to keep track of free chuncks.
    Each chunck has both a header and a footer.
    The actual size of the allocated chuncks is rounded up to the nearest
    multiple of 16 bytes.
    Chuncks are always aligned on a 16 byte boundary.
    Allocation uses the next-fit policy.

Note to students:
    This work was completed in the context of a university course. Implementing
    a memory allocator is a common assignment task for introductory operating
    systems courses.
